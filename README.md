# My Notes App

A mobile web app that allows you to create, edit, and view notes. The mobile web app is built with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) on the front-end with a very basic [node](https://nodejs.org/) + [express](http://expressjs.com/) server.

Notes are stored using the browser's local storage.

Access the web app on your mobile browser here: https://my-notes-app.herokuapp.com/
